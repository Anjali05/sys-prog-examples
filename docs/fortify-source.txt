You can use "#define _FORTIFY_SOURCE 1" in your C code or use "-D_FORTIFY_SOURCE=1"  with GCC to enable additional buffer overflow checks. Some of the checks are identified at runtime and others are flagged as warnings at compile-time.

You can also set _FORTIFY_SOURCE to 2 for additional checks, but you might get some false positives.
